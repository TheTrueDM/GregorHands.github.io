							 <h3 style = 'color:#2F5496;'  >Work Experience</h3>
							<p><b>September 2019: Army Reservist</b><br>
								I have recently furthered my Army Reserves career by passing basic and trade training within the top 3rd. I have been given a lead role in implementing use of a virtual training environment to adapt the way training was delivered. This provided the unique challenge of tailoring documentation and delivering training that had to accessible and effective across
								 many different platforms and to a very varied user group many of whom had a low level of competence with technology and more modern communication platforms.
							</p>
							<p><b>November - December 2018: Aura Gold Lounge Team</b><br>
								Greeting and hosting groups of customers, including upselling bottle packages to provide a more exclusive experience. This again required good people skills and communication.
							</p>
							<p><b>September - November 2018: Home Fundraising</b><br>
								Door to door fundraising for various charitable campaigns helped me develop more confidence in situations that many find uncomfortable as well as adapting my communication style to suit the induvial and situations I found myself in.
							</p>
							<p><b>November 2017: Neon Digital Arts Festival Volunteer</b><br>
								Assisted in the advertisement of the event. I was heavily involved in the preparation of space and installation of exhibits and art pieces; also, the running of a workshop that made Wi-Fi boosters from recycled goods.
							</p>
							<p><b>October 2016 - May 2017: Internship, The High School of Dundee Development Office</b><br>
								I was tasked with a wide a variety of responsibilities from filing, database entry and searching, researching former pupils not logged in the database, assisting at reunions, and fundraising functions, as well as participating in two intensive, targeted, fundraising phone campaigns.
							</p>

							 <h3 style = 'color:#2F5496;'  >Technology Interests</h3>
							<p>I am interested in Machine Learning and Data Science, and I have driven my honours project in a direction that allows me to explore these areas further, as it is not covered by the taught modules. Additionally, I participated in CTFs hosted by TryHackMe which gave me the opportunity to practice the skills 
								I’ve learned in my studies in a more realistic setting, as well as being exposed to new techniques. I also attend the 
								Ethical Hacking society which provide networking opportunities and discussions about new topics such as the comparison between security features of MacOS vs Windows and ethics behind exposing Zero Day exploits, publicly and privately.</p>
