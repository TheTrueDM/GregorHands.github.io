							<h1>Mobile Forensics Discussion</h1>
							<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;text-align:justify;'>Introduction</h2>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>With the increased presence and capabilities of mobile devices in society, there is also an increase in the use of these devices in criminal activity. Digital forensic examiners are employed to access and decipher information stored on these devices to extract evidence to be used in a court of law. Phone manufacturers have taken many measures to protect users&rsquo; and user data from malicious actors and consequently have created difficulties for the forensic investigation process. There are also principles outlined for forensic examiners to follow to ensure data integrity and to produce admissible evidence, creating additional challenges for the digital forensic examiners. This essay will discuss some of the challenges faced by digital forensic examiners and the methods used to surmount them.</p>
							<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;'>Data Integrity and Principles of Digital Evidence</h2>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Integrity of digital evidence is an important element to consider throughout the examination process of mobile forensics. ACPO Good Practice Guide for Police Officers for Digital Evidence defines 4 principles of digital evidence (ACPO, 2012, p6):</p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>Principle 1: No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court.</em></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>Principle 2: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access the original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions.</em></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>Principle 3: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.&nbsp;</em></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>Principle 4: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.</em></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>However, it is also stated in the explanation of the principles that</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>&ldquo;the application of the principles does not preclude a proportionate approach to the examination of digital evidence.&rdquo;</em> (ACPO, 2012, p7)</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>The lack of precise terminology, by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;proportionate&rdquo;, means that the principles are not binding, giving leniency to investigators, in particular the alteration of a device as per principle 1. It is essential for leniency to be granted in regard to the alteration of a device as the state of the device and the information on the mobile device is highly likely to be changed whenever the device is opened, powered on, or powered off. However, it could be argued that no leniency should be allowed at all regarding Principle 3, as an audit trail of all processes is vital to the integrity of the evidence.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Mountrakis and Ioannou (2019) explain that admissibility of evidence is decided by a judge on a few key factors; key factors relating to digital evidence are determining the authenticity of the documentation, which in turn is part of demonstrating the authenticity of the evidence (Mountrakis and Ioannou, 2019). Digital forensic examiners can demonstrate the authenticity of the evidence by hashing the digital evidence when it is first collected and hashing the evidence at a later date to demonstrate that the evidence is unchanged. Additionally, the examiners must also be able to evidence auditability through use of an independent assessor, justifiability by justifying their actions and the methods used, repeatability such that an independent assessor could repeat the tasks, and reproducibility such that a different test environment would produce the same results (Mountrakis and Ioannou, 2019). The data recovery methods that are discussed below (Methods of Acquisition) all require that some degree of alteration be made to the seized device and hence the factors of admissibility must be kept in constant consideration by the digital forensic examiners.</p>

								<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  text-align:justify;'>Security Features of Devices &ndash; iOS and Android</h2>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>iOS (Apple) and Android based operating systems account for the vast majority of the market share of mobile devices. Between 2019 and 2021, the reported market share of different mobile platforms shows Windows phones to be the only other phones to have a market share, and they did not reach 1%. The most up to date figures, from September 2021, show Android at 60.6% and iOS at 39.4% of the market share (KANTAR, 2021). Hence this paper will focus on the security features of iOS and Android devices and how those features impact investigations and examiners.</p>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Many consider biometrics to be a security feature, however, it is an additional form of unlocking mobile devices because at no point is a mobile device able to be unlocked purely by biometric methods without the option of unlocking it with password or pin code. The methods of acquisition discussed relate to bypassing the locking mechanisms in general, hence biometrics are not being discussed within the scope of this paper.</p>
								<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  text-align:justify;'>iOS</h3>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>iOS encrypts data stored in the flash memory using hardware accelerated advanced encryption standard (AES), the encryption methods used are referred to as a file-based encryption (FBE) model. iOS devices offer 4 different tiers of encryption for developers to implement; Complete Protection, Protected Unless Open, Protected Until First User Authentication, and No Protection (Apple, 2021). Complete Protection removes the unencrypted class key from RAM once the device has been locked. Protected Unless Open is used for background process that need to be secured, for example, when downloading an email attachment in the background, the unencrypted per-file key is removed from memory as soon as the process is complete. Protected Until First User Authentication is the default standard of encryption for third party applications if the data protection class is not defined. This acts the same as Complete Protection, except that the unencrypted key is not removed from RAM on device lock. The No Protection class key is protected by hardware encryption, and is unencrypted once the device is booted, this allows the device to manage simple operations like receive phone calls before being unlocked. The No Protection class key is kept in effaceable storage, this is an area of memory used to store cryptographic keys and manage the key hierarchy (Apple, 2021).</p>
								<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  text-align:justify;'>Android</h3>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Android has similar features implemented to protect users&rsquo; data. <span   >The documentation for Android provides considerable detail about the encryption methods used across different versions. In Android 4.4 to Android 9.0, full disk encryption (FDE) was implemented as standard, FDE encrypts the full device whilst it is turned off (Android, 2021; Samsung, 2021). In Android 7.0 to 9.0, FBE was supported and Green (2016), highlights this as a more flexible data protection scheme than FDE, as different areas of user information are protected by different keys (Green, 2016). Android 10 no longer supports FDE and is encrypted with a pure FBE structure instead, this, like iOS devices, uses hardware enhanced AES encryption and each file has a unique key, derived from a primary key.</span></p>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span   >Android&rsquo;s FBE offers less control to developers than Apple&rsquo;s Data Protection Classes, as Android&rsquo;s FBE has only two options, Credential Encrypted (CE) and Device Encrypted (DE) (Android, 2021). DE acts similarly to Apple&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span>Protected Until First User Authentication class, where once the user has unlocked the device, the unencrypted key remains in memory. DE is similar to Apple&rsquo;s No Protection class, where the key is unencrypted on device boot prior to the user unlocking the device. Android explains this as an improvement to security as it allows the data of different users&rsquo; data on the same device to remain encrypted.<span   >&nbsp;</span></p>
								<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Remote Wiping</h3>
								<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Another feature highlighted by Nachenberg (2013) is the remote wiping capabilities of iOS. Remote wiping makes the device unreadable by deleting the hardware encryption key kept in the effaceable storage from a Mobile Device Management solution. The device can also be set up to delete the hardware encryption key when the user&rsquo;s password has been entered incorrectly too many times.<span   >&nbsp;Remote wiping is also a feature of Android devices; however, it was not implemented until 2013. Leom, Choo and Hunt (2015) discusses the effectiveness of remote wiping and highlights what data can still be recovered post wipe. It is demonstrated that next to none of the data could be recovered after remote wiping, and most third-party applications used the same processes as Android&rsquo;s built-in secure deletion functionality (Leom, Choo, and Hunt 2015).&nbsp;</span></p>

								<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Methods of Acquisition</h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>There are 3 types of methods of acquiring data from a seized mobile device, these are manual, logical, and physical acquisition. Manual acquisition is where an investigator manual examines the device by manipulating the visually displayed contents through manual manipulation of the touchscreen, keyboard, and buttons of the device. Logical acquisition is the analysis of a copy of the allocated memory spaces, this is done through a transfer of data through wired or wireless methods, such as USB, Bluetooth, WiFi or IrDA. Physical acquisition is when a copy is made of the full physical memory of the device, this is done by either using specialist software with custom bootloaders, or physically removing the memory chip by desoldering it from the device.</p>
<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Pros and Cons of the Methods</h3>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Sathe and Dongre (2018) discuss the methods of acquisition, highlighting what situations they are suitable for and the weaknesses and strengths of each method.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Manual acquisition, by nature, modifies the state of the device, hence, following principle 1 of the Principles of Digital Evidence (detailed above) this can draw into question the integrity of the investigator and the information discovered. Using stringent documentation of the audit trail of every action carried out upon the device would help to mitigate potential doubts as to the integrity of the data acquired. Additionally, there is also no way to recover deleted information with this method of manual acquisition. However, manual acquisition is a good method for quick investigation and retrieving information such as messages, photos and videos that are readily interpretable by non-experts such jury members.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>When using the method of logical acquisition, considerable expertise and knowledge is required from the digital forensic examiner as different connection methods have different data transferring protocols. There are optimal methods for connecting depending on the operating system and indeed the version of the operating system. Wired connection as opposed to IrDA or Bluetooth may be required for some systems (Ahmed and Dharaskar, 2008); however, it should be noted that this paper is somewhat outdated in this fast moving area, but it serves to recognise some of the principles used in modern methods.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Physical acquisition is often the method required to analyse devices that have been severely damaged, and when a more thorough and detailed analysis is suitable for the investigation, as physical acquisition is capable of recovering deleted data. The issues with physical acquisition are that the procedure takes more time as the data retrieved needs to be adapted into an interpretable format and when the memory chip needs to be removed, specific expertise is required to reduce the chance of severe damage to the seized device (Sathe and Dongre, 2018).</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Difficulties Posed by the Security Features</h2>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span   >These security measures, described above, cause difficulties for forensic investigators when trying to extract data from a seized device using traditional methods. Manual extraction isn&rsquo;t initially available to the examiner as it requires the examiner to have the user authentication credentials to unlock the device in a fully operational state&nbsp;</span>(Fukami, Stoykov and Geradts, 2021). Logical extraction is also made more difficult as the user authentication credentials are again required. The digital forensic examiner is required to modify the device to enable debugging processes in order to extract the data as many of these processes are disabled by manufacturers in modern phones when the device is shipped to retail. Physical extraction is a process that makes it possible to negate the locking mechanisms of a device, however, like logical extraction, the debugging interfaces to retrieve the data are often disabled by the manufacturer. The digital forensic examiner will need to determine the best method to enable the debugging methods, it is also important to note that the data retrieved will be in an encrypted state and hence require decryption processes in order to be readable (Fukami, Stoykov and Geradts, 2021). <span   >It is also important for examiners to be aware of potential risk of a remote wipe command being sent when retrieving a device from a scene, the risk of a device being remotely wiped can be mitigated by securing a device in a Faraday cage, this blocks electronic signals from entering or exiting the container.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Not only do the digital forensic examiners have to overcome the challenges of the security measures implemented on iOS and Android devices, but they also have to ensure that there is data integrity maintained throughout the examination process. They are able to adopt a variety of methods to overcome these difficulties, which are discussed below (Alternative Methods).</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Alternative Methods</h3>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Loading a custom boot loader was traditionally enabled by the device manufacturer. Special modes, such as rescue mode or download mode, allowed users to run a custom boot loader on the target system during the boot-up. However, in order to maintain system integrity in modern devices, manufacturers now only enable boot loaders to run that have been properly verified, allowing only their codes to run on the device (Fukami, Stoykov and Geradts, 2021). Boot loaders manipulate the booting process of devices and are responsible for initialising hardware components; mobile devices have multiple boot loader steps. The primary boot loader (PBL) or sometimes referred to as bootROM is hard coded onto the read only memory (ROM), the PBL loads the secondary boot loader (SBL), the SBL loads another boot loader that loads the operating system. Boot loaders start hardware components, the operating system, and device operations like encryption. SBLs with known vulnerabilities can be flashed onto the device for the digital forensic examiner to exploit, granting the highest level of privileges, which in turn grants access to the memory data&nbsp;(Fukami, Stoykov and Geradts, 2021).</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Locking mechanisms of a device can be bypassed by deleting lock related data on a target device. Locking mechanisms can also be circumvented by changing the boot process to skip the locking operation&nbsp;(Fukami, Stoykov and Geradts, 2021). This demonstrates that bypassing the security feature of locking mechanisms is another method that digital forensic examiners can use in order to gain access to users&rsquo; data. &nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>In addition to these various approaches to unlocking devices for data acquisition, there is legislation that has been introduced to support the digital forensic examiners in gaining user authentication through the granting of decryption orders.</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Decryption Orders&nbsp;</h3>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Decryption orders are powers granted to law enforcement agencies to aid in decrypting devices, by forcing individuals to hand over the decryption keys. The introduction of this legislation is justified by The Department of Trade and Industry,&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>&ldquo;We are persuaded that encryption will increasingly be a source of advantage to criminals with which law enforcement agencies are, at present, inadequately prepared to deal.&rdquo;</em> (DTI, 1999, p10).</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>Part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000 relates to encryption.&nbsp;Akdeniz, Taylor and Walker (2018) explain that section 49 defines situations that requires disclosure of protected information from the person believed to hold the encryption key for said information. The scenarios are:</p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>(a) in the interests of national security;</em></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>&nbsp;(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime; or</em></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><em>&nbsp;(c) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.</em></p>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'>They also point out that <span   >the European Court of Human Rights condemned the vague wording of laws that interfere with private life and correspondence, in particular the term &ldquo;national security&rdquo;. This would suggest that section 49(3) does not adequately detail the basis for a decryption order&nbsp;</span>(Akdeniz, Taylor, Walker, 2018)<span   >.&nbsp;</span></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span>Another critique of this law is that it potentially forces self-incrimination, which there are privileges against, however a ruling was made in R vs S and A (2008), disallowing a plea against complying with a section 49 notice on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. This decision was reached as it was argued that the encryption key exists out with the will of the individual, even if said key exists only in the mind of said individual. This conclusion was based on Saunders v. The United Kingdom (1996), that ruled the privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to materials that are gathered through compulsory powers, for example documents gathered with a warrant, or samples required for DNA testing; hence the encryption key is considered similarly.&nbsp;</span></p>
							<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
							<h2 style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;color:#2F5496;  '>Conclusion</h2>
							<p style ='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;text-align:justify;'><span>In conclusion, there are many hinderances to extracting data from a mobile device as a digital forensic examiner, in the terms of encryption employed by Android and iOS, it is also challenging to prove adherence to the principles of digital evidence as stated by ACPO (2012). There are however methods that are able to negate the security measures put in place, as well as legislation granting powers to access encrypted data. There are also clear differences in the digital forensic laboratory facilities across different police forces, hence there is a lack of standardisation of approach to mobile digital forensics regarding what procedures are handled in-house and which are out-sourced, even within the UK itself (Ho and Li eds, 2015, p30). Methods used in mobile digital forensics will change constantly, as the technology and security features of mobile devices are also changing. Best practices, guidelines, and legislation will most likely need to change with the development of new technologies, to fully enable the capabilities of digital forensic examiners and law enforcement.&nbsp;</span></p>
